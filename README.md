# AI GitHub Helper

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: This is a Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This project uses potentially dangerous flags and modes for rapid development and testing:
- **`--dangerously-skip-permissions`** (Claude CLI): Bypasses permission checks
- **`--yolo`** (Gemini CLI): Experimental/unsafe operation mode

**Use with extreme caution** and only on machines where security and data integrity are not critical concerns. These flags disable important safety mechanisms and could pose security risks. This is experimental software not intended for production use on systems with sensitive data or in environments where security is paramount.

**Purpose**: This project provides functionality similar to [claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) but with the flexibility to swap AI providers and use your own subscriptions instead of API keys, helping you avoid unexpected bills while experimenting with AI-powered code review automation.

- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Secure authentication using pre-configured `gh` CLI
- **Multi-AI Provider Support**: Works with Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, or auto-detection
- **Flexible AI Prompts**: Customizable review behavior via Markdown templates
- **Provider Fallback**: Automatic fallback between AI providers for reliability
- **Inline Comments**: Detailed feedback with batch comment posting
- **Review Actions**: Automated approve/request-changes/comment decisions
- **Detached Processing**: Non-blocking webhook handling for optimal performance
- **Shell Script Integration**: Reusable bash scripts for GitHub operations

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the AI GitHub Helper, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2. **GitHub CLI** installed and authenticated
   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
   brew install gh  # macOS
   # or follow instructions at https://cli.github.com/

   # Authenticate with GitHub
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **AI Provider CLI** - Choose one or both:

   ### Option 1: Claude Code CLI (Default)
   ```bash
   # Install Claude Code CLI
   # Follow instructions at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

   # Authenticate with Claude
   claude auth
   ```

   ### Option 2: Google Gemini CLI
   ```bash
   # Install Gemini CLI
   npm install -g @google-cloud/gemini-cli

   # Authenticate with Google
   gemini auth  # Follow interactive authentication
   ```

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your configuration:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
HOST=localhost

# GitHub Configuration
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here

# AI Configuration
AI_WORKING_DIR=/tmp/ai-github-helper
AI_PROVIDER=claude                # Options: claude, gemini, auto
AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED=false        # Enable automatic fallback between providers
```

### 3. Generate Webhook Secret

Generate a secure webhook secret:

```bash
# Generate a random secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Copy this value to your `.env` file as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm run build
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

## GitHub Repository Setup

To connect this system to your GitHub repository:

### 1. Expose Your Local Server (Development)

For local development, use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server:

```bash
# Install ngrok (if not already installed)
brew install ngrok  # macOS

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 3000
```

This will give you a public URL like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`.

### 2. Configure GitHub Webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
3. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-domain.com/webhook` (or your ngrok URL + `/webhook`)
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: The webhook secret you generated earlier
   - **Events**: Select "Pull requests", "Pull request reviews", "Pull request review comments", "Issues", and "Issue comments"
   - **Active**: ✅ Checked

4. Click **Add webhook**

### 3. Test the Setup

1. Create a test pull request in your repository
2. Check your server logs to see if the webhook was received
3. The AI should automatically review the PR and add comments

## How It Works

The system operates as a stateless, asynchronous webhook server with two main workflows:

### Pull Request Review Workflow

1. **Webhook Reception**: GitHub sends a `pull_request` event when a PR is opened/updated
2. **Security Verification**: HMAC signature validation ensures the request is authentic
3. **Prompt Generation**: Dynamic prompt creation by injecting PR context into templates
4. **Detached AI Process**: Background AI execution spawned as a separate process
5. **Fast Response**: Immediate `200 OK` response to GitHub (prevents timeouts)
6. **AI-Driven Review**: The AI follows scripted instructions to:
   - Check out the PR branch using `gh pr checkout`
   - Analyze code changes with `gh pr diff`
   - Post batch inline comments via helper scripts
   - Submit final review decision (approve/request-changes/comment)
7. **Cleanup**: Temporary prompt files are automatically removed

### Issue-Based AI Helper Workflow

1. **Issue Creation/Comment**: User creates an issue or comments on an existing issue mentioning `@ai-helper`
2. **AI Helper Detection**: The system detects the mention and triggers the AI helper workflow
3. **Issue Analysis**: AI analyzes the issue description and requirements
4. **Branch Creation**: AI creates a new feature/fix branch for the issue
5. **Code Implementation**: AI implements the requested feature or fix following project patterns
6. **Pull Request Creation**: AI creates a pull request with comprehensive description
7. **Automatic Linking**: PR is automatically linked to the original issue using "Closes #X"

### Using the Issue-Based AI Helper

To use the issue-based AI helper:

1. **Create an Issue**: Create a GitHub issue describing what you want implemented
2. **Mention the AI Helper**: Include `@ai-helper` anywhere in the issue title, description, or comments
3. **Wait for Processing**: The AI will automatically start analyzing and implementing your request
4. **Review the PR**: The AI will create a pull request with the implementation for your review

**Example Issue:**
```
Title: Add user authentication feature
Description: 
We need to implement user authentication with login/logout functionality.
The feature should include:
- Login form with email/password
- JWT token handling
- Protected routes
- User session management

@ai-helper implement this feature
```

The AI will automatically:
- Create a new branch (`feature/issue-123` or similar)
- Implement the authentication system
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Create a pull request with detailed description
- Link the PR to close the original issue

### Interactive Review Comments Workflow

The system also supports interactive code review assistance through review comments:

1. **Review Comment Creation**: A reviewer adds a comment on a PR review and mentions `@ai-helper`
2. **AI Helper Detection**: The system detects the mention in review comments
3. **Context Analysis**: AI analyzes the specific comment, file, and diff context
4. **Targeted Response**: AI provides specific implementation or fixes based on the comment
5. **Direct Implementation**: AI can directly implement requested changes and push to the PR branch

### Using Interactive Review Comments

To get AI assistance during code review:

1. **Start a PR Review**: Begin reviewing a pull request normally
2. **Add Specific Comments**: Comment on specific lines or sections of code
3. **Mention the AI Helper**: Include `@ai-helper` in your review comment
4. **Request Specific Actions**: Be specific about what you want implemented

**Example Review Comments:**
```
Line-specific comment: "This function needs error handling @ai-helper add try-catch"
General comment: "@ai-helper refactor this component to use hooks instead of class components"
Security comment: "@ai-helper this looks vulnerable to XSS, please sanitize the input"
```

The AI will:
- Understand the specific context of your comment
- Access the relevant code file and surrounding diff
- Implement the requested changes directly
- Push commits to the PR branch
- Reply to confirm the implementation

### Architecture Benefits

- **Non-blocking**: Webhook endpoint remains responsive
- **Secure**: No API tokens stored; relies on pre-authenticated CLI tools
- **Scalable**: Stateless design supports multiple concurrent reviews
- **Extensible**: Bash scripts provide reusable GitHub operation interfaces

### Key Components

- **Webhook Server**: Express.js server handling GitHub webhook events (pull requests, reviews, issues, comments)
- **Pull Request Handler**: Automated code review system with AI-driven feedback
- **Review Comment Handler**: Interactive AI assistance for PR review comments and general reviews
- **Issue Handler**: AI helper that responds to `@ai-helper` mentions in issues
- **AI Scripts**: Markdown-based prompt templates with dynamic context injection
- **Shell Scripts**: Bash utilities providing GitHub CLI operation interfaces
- **Middleware**: Security and request validation components
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

## Configuration Options

Environment variables you can set:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` | No |
| `HOST` | Server host | `localhost` | No |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | GitHub webhook secret for HMAC validation | - | Yes |
| `AI_WORKING_DIR` | Directory for AI operations | `/tmp/ai-github-helper` | No |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | AI provider to use (`claude`, `gemini`, `auto`) | `claude` | No |
| `AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED` | Enable automatic fallback between providers | `false` | No |

### AI Provider Configuration

The system supports multiple AI providers with automatic fallback:

#### Provider Options

- **`claude`**: Uses Claude Code CLI (Anthropic) - paid service with high quality
- **`gemini`**: Uses Gemini CLI (Google) - free tier available
- **`auto`**: Automatically selects the first available provider (claude → gemini)

#### Provider Features

| Feature | Claude | Gemini |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Cost** | Paid service | Free tier: 60 req/min, 1000/day |
| **Installation** | Built-in auth flow | NPM package |
| **Quality** | High-quality responses | Good quality responses |
| **Rate Limits** | Usage-based billing | Free tier limits |

#### Fallback Behavior

When `AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`:
- If primary provider is unavailable, automatically tries the fallback
- Provides redundancy and reduces service interruption
- Logs which provider is actually used for each request

### Security Notes

- **GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET**: Must match the secret configured in your GitHub webhook settings
- **CLI Authentication**: AI provider CLIs must be pre-authenticated
- **No API Tokens**: The system deliberately avoids storing API tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not received**
   - Check if your server is running and accessible
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct
   - Check GitHub webhook delivery logs

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Make sure `gh auth login` is completed
   - Verify `claude-code auth` is set up
   - Check that the GitHub CLI has access to your repository

3. **AI execution fails**
   - Ensure your chosen AI provider CLI is installed and authenticated
   - For Claude: `claude auth` and verify connection
   - For Gemini: `gemini auth` and verify connection
   - Check the AI working directory exists and is writable
   - Verify the webhook secret matches between GitHub and your `.env`
   - Try `AI_PROVIDER=auto` to test provider availability

### Logs

Check the server logs for detailed error information:

```bash
npm run dev
# Server logs will show webhook events and AI execution details
```

### Testing Locally

You can test the AI executor manually:

```bash
# Test Claude CLI directly
claude "Review this code and provide feedback"

# Test Gemini CLI directly  
gemini "Review this code and provide feedback"

# Test GitHub CLI
gh pr list
gh pr checkout <number>
gh pr diff <number>
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Use a proper domain** instead of ngrok
2. **Set up SSL/TLS** for webhook security
3. **Use PM2** or similar for process management
4. **Configure proper logging** and monitoring
5. **Set up environment variables** securely
6. **Monitor AI process execution** and cleanup
7. **Configure rate limiting** for webhook endpoints
8. **Set up health checks** for the webhook server

### Performance Considerations

- **Concurrent Reviews**: The detached process model supports multiple simultaneous PR reviews
- **Resource Management**: Monitor disk usage for temporary prompt files
- **AI Rate Limits**: Be aware of your AI provider's rate limits and quotas
