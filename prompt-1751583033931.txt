### 3. Code Review Focus Areas
When reviewing the code, focus on:
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, maintainable code
- **Potential Bugs**: Logic errors, edge cases, null pointer issues
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication, sensitive data exposure
- **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, unnecessary operations
- **Best Practices**: Language-specific conventions, design patterns
- **Testing**: Are tests adequate? Are edge cases covered?

```bash
gh pr review 1 --approve --body "Code looks good!"
```

### 5. Review Guidelines
- Be constructive and helpful in your feedback

## Code Review Summary

I've reviewed the changes in this PR. Here are my findings:

### Positive Notes:
- Good use of error handling in the authentication module
- Clean separation of concerns in the new components

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Consider adding input validation on lines 23-25 of user-service.ts
- The database query on line 67 might benefit from adding an index for performance

### Minor Issues:
- Unused import on line 3 of utils.ts
- Consider using const instead of let on line 45 where the variable isn't reassigned

Overall, the code quality is good and the implementation follows the project's patterns well."
